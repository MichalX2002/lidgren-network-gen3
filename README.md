## Lidgren.Network
Networking library for .NET, which uses a single UDP socket to deliver an API for connecting clients to a server; reading, sending, or streaming messages.

Depends on .NET 5 and aims to be updated for the newest runtimes.

### Stability
The current stability of this fork is low. There are barely any tests and it is not production ready.  
The API is also constantly being iterated upon so don't get too attached.
